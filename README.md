# kodelive

project I'm working on to create a community of developers that can help eachother out through p2p video chats.

Will be using React, Expressjs, TailwindCSS, NodeJS, Websocket (for live video), Cloudlflare for CDN, Twilio API, Socket.io (to showcase live users) & Lunrjs for tag based searches.
